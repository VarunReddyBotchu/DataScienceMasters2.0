    "##### The three major differences between multiprocessing and multithreading in Python are:\n",
    "1. Memory Space: In multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space, whereas in multithreading, all threads within a process share the same memory space.\n",
    "2. Concurrency Model: Multiprocessing achieves parallelism by executing multiple processes simultaneously, utilizing multiple CPUs or cores. On the other hand, multithreading achieves concurrency within a single process by interleaving the execution of multiple threads within the same CPU or core.\n",
    "3. Overhead: Multiprocessing typically has higher overhead compared to multithreading. Creating and managing processes involve more resources and time due to the need for separate memory spaces and process management.\n",
    "##### These differences impact how concurrency is achieved and how resources are managed in multiprocessing and multithreading. Choosing between them depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for parallelism, data sharing, and resource efficiency."

It enables parallel execution of tasks by distributing them among the available processes. The pool abstracts away the process creation and management, allowing the programmer to focus on defining the tasks to be executed. It is particularly useful when dealing with computationally intensive or I/O-bound tasks, as it maximizes resource utilization and improves overall performance by leveraging multiple processes."
